This game was inspired by a game called 23 Miles deep, released in 2019 by Odd Giant (Known in Brazil as Amdre young) in the play store. The game was removed from store since no updates had been released for two years, so Google removed the app from the store.

This project tries to revive this game, since it has incredible potential, rewritting it from scratch in a new engine we will be improving everything the old game had, adding new content and other stuff.
